Title: Energy Storage Optimization

- If you have a home battery, reserve 20–30% state-of-charge for peak-rate hours and emergency backup.
- Charge the battery from solar during midday; discharge into the home during evening peaks.
- Avoid frequent 0–100% cycles; keep between 20–90% for longevity unless a storm is forecast.
- Pair battery discharge with EV charging pauses to flatten peaks and minimize demand charges.
- Monitor round-trip efficiency and prioritize high-value uses (peak shaving over off-peak arbitrage in most cases).
