Title: Seasonal Energy Management Guide

- Winter: preheat during low-cost hours, seal drafts, and use ceiling fans on reverse to push warm air down.
- Summer: pre-cool before peak, close blinds on sunny sides, and ventilate at night if outdoor temps drop.
- Shoulder seasons: capitalize on free cooling/heating by opening windows when outdoor temp is between 16–22°C.
- Adjust EV charging start times seasonally to avoid overlapping with heating/cooling surges.
- Review your tariff changes each season; some utilities shift peak windows in summer.
