Title: Smart Home Automation Tips for Load Shifting

- Create automations that delay non-urgent appliances (dishwasher, laundry, pool pump) to off-peak windows or when solar is abundant.
- Use occupancy sensors to shut off HVAC in unused zones and dim lighting automatically.
- Stagger EV charging start times to avoid coincident peaks with HVAC or cooking.
- Pair price alerts with device schedules: when rates spike, pause flexible loads for 30–60 minutes.
- Track vampire loads with smart plugs and cut power automatically during long idle periods.
