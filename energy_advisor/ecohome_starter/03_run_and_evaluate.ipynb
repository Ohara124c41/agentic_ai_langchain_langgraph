      "### Summary\n",
      "To minimize costs and maximize solar power for charging your electric vehicle (EV) tomorrow in San Francisco, the best time to charge is during the late morning to early afternoon when solar generation is highest and electricity rates are lower.\n",

      "- You want to charge your EV using solar power during the day.\n",
      "- You are looking for the most cost-effective charging window based on electricity prices and solar generation forecasts.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Tools Used (with outputs)\n",
      "1. **Electricity Prices** (for 2023-10-06):\n",
      "   - Off-Peak Rates: 00:00-05:59 (0.128 - 0.179 USD/kWh)\n",
      "   - Peak Rates: 16:00-20:59 (0.294 - 0.308 USD/kWh)\n",
      "   - Lowest off-peak rate: 0.128 USD/kWh at 04:00.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Weather Forecast**:\n",
      "   - Solar irradiance peaks between 12:00 and 14:00 with values of 900.0 and 869.3 W/m\u00b2 respectively.\n",
      "   - Significant solar generation expected from 09:00 to 15:00.\n",

      "### Recommendations (with times)\n",
      "- **Charge your EV from 12:00 to 14:00**:\n",
      "  - This window aligns with peak solar generation, ensuring you utilize solar power effectively.\n",
      "  - The electricity rate during this time is 0.177 USD/kWh (off-peak).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Estimated kWh/cost impact\n",
      "- Assuming an average EV charging requirement of 30 kWh:\n",
      "  - Cost during charging window: 30 kWh * 0.177 USD/kWh = **5.31 USD**.\n",
      "- If charged during peak hours (16:00-20:59), the cost could rise to approximately **9.24 USD** (30 kWh * 0.308 USD/kWh).\n",

Based on the current electricity pricing, it appears that there may not be significant savings for the typical appliance usage scenario I calculated.\\n\\n### Assumptions\\n- The calculation was based on a hypothetical current usage of 10 kWh for appliances.\\n- The off-peak rate is lower than the peak rate, but the specific usage and appliance types can greatly affect savings.\\n\\n### Tools Used\\n1. **Electricity Prices**: Current off-peak rates are as follows:\\n   - Super Off-Peak (00:00-05:59): $0.106 - $0.124\\n   - Off-Peak (06:00-16:00, 21:00-23:59): $0.154 - $0.167\\n   - Peak (16:00-20:59): $0.268 - $0.284\\n2. **Energy Savings Calculation**: The calculation showed no savings based on the assumed usage.\\n\\n### Recommendations\\n1. **Shift Usage**: If your appliances can be run during super off-peak hours (00:00-05:59), you can take advantage of the lowest rates.\\n2. **Monitor Actual Usage**: Consider tracking your actual appliance usage to get a more accurate picture of potential savings.\\n3. **Evaluate Specific Appliances**: Some appliances may have higher energy consumption and thus greater potential for savings when shifted to off-peak hours.\\n\\n### Estimated kWh/Cost Impact\\n- Based on the hypothetical scenario, no savings were identified.
